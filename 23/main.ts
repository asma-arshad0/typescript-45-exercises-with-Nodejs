//TASK 23
// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

// let car = 'subaru';

// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

// console.log(car == 'subaru')

// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.

// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.



//Making variables

let three = 3;
let two = 2;

//Test 1
console.log("Test 1: three is equals to 3");
console.log(three == 3);

//Test 2
console.log("\nTest 2: two is equals to 2");
console.log(two == 2);

//Test 3
console.log("\nTest 3: three is not equals to 2");
console.log(three != two);

//Test 4
console.log("\nTest 4: two is not equals to 3");
console.log(two != three);

//Test 5
console.log("\nTest 5: three is greater than 2");
console.log(three > two);

//Test 6
console.log("\nTest 6: 3 is equals to 2");
console.log(three == two);

//Test 7
console.log("\nTest 7: 500 is equals to 50 ");
console.log (500 > 50);

//Test 8
console.log("\nTest 8: three is less than 2");
console.log(three < two);

//Test 9
console.log("\nTest 9: Is three not equals to 3?");
console.log(three != 3);

//Test 10
console.log("\nTest 10: Is two  not equals to 2?");
console.log(two != 2);
