//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

//Define a function to create a car object with optional options..
function create_car(manufacturer, model, ...options){
    //initialize a car object with manufacturer and model
    let car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model
    };

    //Add additional option to the car object 
    options.forEach(option => {
        let [key, value] = option.split(":");
        car [key.trim()] = value.trim();
    });

    return car;
}

//call the function to create a car objevct
let myCar = create_car("Honda", "Civic", "Color: Black", "Sunroof: True", "Year: 2024");

//Print the variables
console.log(myCar
);
